# EyeGuard – Preliminary Eye Symptom Assessment Tool

EyeGuard is a simple, rule-based web application designed to help users recognize common eye-related symptoms and understand when they should seek professional eye care.

This project focuses on awareness and early caution, especially for critical visual symptoms.


## 🚀 Features

- Checklist of eye-related symptoms
- Symptoms grouped into:
  - Mild
  - Moderate
  - Critical (red-flag) symptoms
- Visual examples for difficult-to-describe symptoms like:
  - Floaters
  - Curtain or shadow over vision
- Rule-based severity assessment
- Clear emergency warning for critical symptoms
- Beginner-friendly, transparent logic


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (no frameworks, no backend)


## 🧠 How It Works

- Users select symptoms they are experiencing
- The system checks symptom categories using simple if-else logic
- Based on selection:
  - Critical symptoms → urgent medical advice
  - Multiple moderate symptoms → doctor consultation recommended
  - Mild symptoms → basic eye care guidance

This approach keeps the logic explainable and safe.
